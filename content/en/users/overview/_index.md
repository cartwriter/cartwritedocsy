## Who is a User

Everyone who accesses [Carteret Writers](https://carteretwriters.org) is considered a user.

### Visitors

Users who aren't members are considered visitors and the information we will provide reflects this distinction. Information about joining will be prominent.

### Members

Members hold a special status as a user. They will require additional information - or in some cases, more extensive information. The information for the most part is still publicly available, but it won't mean much to visitors.

### Administrators

Members that have taken on administrative reponsibilities will require unique information than other groups.

### Board Members

Members with additional responsibilities for managing the organization are Board Members. Their responsibilities may vary, but as the person holding the position on the board may change, the information needs to be preserved and passed on.

### Developers

Developers may or may not be members. They are responsible for the underlying technology used by Carteret Writers.

## Additional Information

Additional information may be available in the **Carteret Writers Forum**.
